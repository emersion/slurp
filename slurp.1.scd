# NAME

slurp - select a region in a Wayland compositor

# SYNOPSIS

*slurp* [options...]

# DESCRIPTION

slurp is a command-line utility to select a region from Wayland compositors
which support the layer-shell protocol. It lets the user hold the pointer to
select, or click to cancel the selection.

If the standard input is not a TTY or the -r option is used, slurp will read a
list of predefined rectangles for quick selection. Each line must be in the form
"<x>,<y> <width>x<height> [label]". The label is optional and can be any string
that doesn't contain newlines. It can be accessed using the "%l" sequence in a
format string.

If the _Esc_ key is pressed, selection is cancelled. If the _Space_ key is
held, the selection is moved instead of being resized.

# OPTIONS

*-h*
	Show help message and quit.

*-d*
	Display dimensions of selection.

*-b* _color_
	Set background color. See *COLORS* for more detail.

*-c* _color_
	Set border color. See *COLORS* for more detail.

*-s* _color_
	Set selection color. See *COLORS* for more detail.

*-B* _color_
	Set color for highlighting predefined rectangles from standard input when not
	selected.

*-F* _font family_
	Set the font family name when displaying the dimensions box. Only useful
	when combined with the -d option. The available font family names guaranteed
	to work are the standard generic CSS2 options: serif, sans-serif,
	monospace, cursive and fantasy. It defaults to the sans-serif family name.

*-w* _weight_
	Set border weight.

*-f* _format_
	Set format. See *FORMAT* for more detail.

*-p*
	Select a single pixel instead of a rectangle. This mode ignores any
	predefined rectangles read from the standard input.

*-o*
	Add predefined rectangles for all outputs, as if provided on standard input.
	The label will be the name of the output.

*-r*
	Require the user to select one of the predefined rectangles. These can come
	from standard input, if *-o* is used, the rectangles of all display outputs.
	This option conflicts with *-p*.

*-C*
	Prevents exiting immediately once the selection rectangle is defined.
	The user can re-select a new rectangle until the Return key is pressed.
	This option conflicts with *-p*.

*-a* _width_:_height_
	Force selections to have the given aspect ratio. This constraint is not
	applied to the predefined rectangles specified using *-o*.

# COLORS

Colors may be specified in #RRGGBB or #RRGGBBAA format. The # is optional.

# FORMAT

Interpreted sequences are:

%x	The x-coordinate of the selection

%y	The y-coordinate of the selection

%w	The width of the selection

%h	The height of the selection

%X	The x-coordinate of the selection with coordinates relative to the output
	containing the top left corner.

%Y	The y-coordinate of the selection with coordinates relative to the output
	containing the top left corner.

%W	The width of the selection cropped to the output containing the top left
	corner.

%H	The height of the selection cropped to the output containing the top left
	corner.

%l	Label included with region from stdin

%o	The name of the output containing the top left corner, or "<unknown>" if
	not known

The default format is "%x,%y %wx%h\\n".

# KEYBOARD CONTROLS

The following keyboard actions can be used during selection:

*Escape*	Cancel the selection and exit slurp

*Space*	If currently making a selection, while space is held down, move the
entire selection rather than change the selection's size as you move the
pointer.

*Shift*	Experimental. If the *-a* option wasn't specified, then set the aspect
ratio to 1:1 while shift is held down, releasing it restores the un-constrained
aspect ratio. *Note:* This behavior may change in the future depending on
feedback.

*Return*	If the *-C* option is specified, slurp will wait until the Return
key is pressed before exiting.
